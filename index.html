                                                My name is Nicholas, but I go by Nick. I am 24 years old and
                                                I spend most of my time running around with my 6 year old daughter.
                                                Her name is Mirabelle. She is the sweetest little girl you will ever
                                                meet. We are always running around doing something.
                                                Mainly we go to her gymnastics practice, but when she doesn't have
                                                prectice we enjoy going to the movie. We switch off on who
                                                gets to pick the movie. Also, we like to go to Nebraska Furniture mart
                                                nd play with all the cool things they have. We switch it
                                                up depending on how we are feeling that day. That's pretty much how I
                                                spend my time.

                                        <section class="p2">Something that I used to do a lot is ride bulls. I loved
                                                ridding bulls, but I don't have too much time for it anymore. I do like
                                                to travel the world. I have been to many places. My top two places so
                                                far are Rome or Istanbul. It's great getting to see
                                                different cultures and learning about their history. Also, I enjoy music
                                                and movies. Both very in genre. I like all types of music
                                                and movies as long as they are good. </section>

                                        <section class="p3">Other then that I just work. I am a QA Anylast at EZLynx. I
                                                plan on becoming a Programmer. That's my ideal career. That's why I am
                                                enrolled into the greatest program. It's a coding bootcamp through SMU.
                                                I mainly want to focus more on the backend rather than on
                                                the front end. That's my dream career wise. </section>
